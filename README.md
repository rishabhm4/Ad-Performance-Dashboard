The dashboard describes the analysis of Ad performance.

- It consist of 3 User inputs viz. Year, Accounts and Created Ad Category, which can be used to analyse the data on various parameters.
- It has counters for showing major facts about the advertisement data.
- I added the comparison between Impressions with Ad Created Category and CTA type as well as a wordcloud for highlighting the main topic of the advertisement created by accounts.

Thank You!!
